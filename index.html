Your mark must be left but not with stone, it must be left with resonating frequency, your signature to bring understanding. Speak from your podium for all to hear your message. A giddy feeling runs down along your spine as you realize that you must live up to your word, your self created destiny.Aproach the scary and painful maze, it has bright prospects on either side. Forks will be given to you in this path whether they are true, that is left for you to learn. This will be the only part of the path where it will be more effective to leave a part of you than to gain. A dance against the world itself, and to earn your passage you must use your gifts and passion. Finding them is the only way to win the dance.Let go the regrets of the past, learn from them, be better.Float through a global conscious,tap into it. You will now float through the path, back to where you started.Second pass through understanding brings you to truly love and appreciate all from before.The pieces float into the sky, you float, you are now the world. You now have your chance to be Goodough.Giraldus was hurled rapidly into another conscious.  A conscious which he innately knew was that of Joiner, a guru of the yellow world.The water splashed methodically against the sea wall, the collisions created small  clouds of cold salty mist, which showered back into the dark water.  The wind had now increased and the pace of the splashes accelerated, sending the mist higher into the air and dampening Joiner as he peered at the soft yellow glowing light.  A dark shadow crossed the light, he tossed his shrimp in created a splash, sending dark waves across the waters surface.   The shadow lingered and then gave way to yellow again. It was disinterested.Joiner placed the rod into the back of his truck and began to drive across the series of bridges that would bring him back to the mainland.  His clock flashed in a dull orange and reminded him it was way too late.  He arrived home, sluggishly opened the door and walked directly to his bed.Soon he was awake in a dreamland, a land of possibilities, experiments were performed information processed, methodology was developed, and simulations took place to determine the best courses of action.  As morning approached and the sound of the rising city grew from a murmur to a roar Joiners eyes struggled to stay shut. Finally he could remain asleep no longer and he sat up to begin his day.Opening his portal he received his chosen news, his viewpoint was bolstered daily by the relentless reportings of his chosen peers, all of them were having the best days they had ever had as was custom to portray through the portal.  The portal had once filled him with wonder, its  ability to provide the information he wanted to hear was astounding. He had begun to feel immune to this knowledge, he wasnâ€™t sure if it was a conscious effort or it just happened gradually over time.  He had joined this world and looked to make it his own.   Reveling in the sameness that came with such submission.  He had joined a rat race, one which he had despised from his upbringing yet he found to be a reality.
